            AniXO is a free-to-use, web-based platform that provides users with an organized index of anime content
            sourced from publicly available third-party providers. The Service functions solely as an aggregation
            and referral interface — it does not host, upload, store, cache, or distribute any video files, audio files,
            or copyrighted media on its own servers or infrastructure.

            All audiovisual content accessible through AniXO is embedded via third-party players and hosted on external servers

            AniXO acts exclusively as an intermediary providing navigational convenience and does not claim any rights
            to the content made accessible through its interface.

            The availability, quality, accuracy, and legality of content accessible through the Service is determined

            availability of any specific content or feature.
